How to name your baby without stress? You obviously want a name that will suit your child. You don't want it too ubiquitous or too abnormal. Luckily, in a world where you can find everything with your phone from some funny cat videos to cooking recipes , there’s definitely long lists of baby names for you to choose.

When it comes to baby name, everyone has an opinion.  Don’t know where to start? 
Let's first find out top 10 most popular names until 2008.

Let's run recommendation. The program aims to allow parents-to-be to tell the gender of the baby and the style of the name they want. If the style is modern, we recommends names from 1990 and up. If the style is classic, we recommend names pre -1900 (1899 and down). If user says none for style, then the year does not matter, we take all the data. The recommended name is the most popular name in that period.
And here's the result:

Or you already have a name in mind but not sure how popular it is compared to others. Say John for example, let's see the popularity of John from 1880 to 2008.

The goal is to create a simple program that would assist a parent-to-be to find a name for his/her baby. For detail about how it works, please visit my github. While play with this data, I just find out some interesting facts about naming a baby around the world.

### 1.Germany
In Germany, you must be able to tell the gender of the child by the first name, and the name chosen must not be negatively affect the well being of the child. Also, you can not use last names or the names of objects or products as first names. For example, a Turkish couple were not allowed to call their baby Osama Bin Laden. One couple named their baby Berlin after the city in which they met, prompting the registrar to mount an objection. He eventually relented after the family's lawyer pointed out that the courts had allowed the name London.

### 2. Sweden
First names must be reported to the Tax Agency, and they allow multiple first names, but if you later change your name you must keep at least one of the first names that you were originally given, and you can only change your name once. For instance, if you’re named John and want to change it to Jack, your new first name will be Jack John, keeping the original first name.

### 3. Denmark
Parents can choose from a list of only 7,000 pre-approved names, some for girls, some for boys. If you want to name your child something that isn't on the list, you have to get special permission from your local church, and the name is then reviewed by governmental officials.

### 4. Japan
When Japanese parents register their newborns, the local authorities can say no if they don't think the name is appropriate. In 1993, the name Akuma, meaning "devil", was not permitted. There are a couple thousand "name kanji" and "commonly used characters" for use in naming babies, and only these official kanji may be used in babies' given names.

### Bonus: The United States
According to UC Davis law professor Carlton Larson, in Massachusetts, each name (first, middle, and last) must be shorter than 40 characters each for computer input reasons. And many states require using only the 26 letters of a standard keyboard. This means in California you can call a child Jose, but technically not José. And in Tennessee, a child of married parents can have either the surname of the father or the surname of the mother in combination with the surname of the father. Either way, the kid’s getting the dad’s name.
