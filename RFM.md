**What is RFM Analysis?**<br> <br>
RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that uses past purchase behavior to divide customers into groups.
<br>
RECENCY (R): Time since last purchase
FREQUENCY (F): Total number of purchases
MONETARY VALUE (M): Total monetary value
<br> <br>
RFM analysis was first used by the direct mail industry more than four decades ago, yet it is still an effective way to optimize your marketing.
