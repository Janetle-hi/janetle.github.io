<br>
On September 4th 2017, Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) published a series revealing how the ‘Azerbaijani Laundromat’ – a major money laundering and lobbying scheme involving Azerbaijan’s ruling elite, European politicians, and a network of anonymous British companies – facilitated more than 16,000 covert payments totalling US $2.9bn (£2.2bn).  <br><br>
In this project, my main purpose is to play with the data with relevant insight on how Money Laundering activity has been identified, then come up with recommendation on action to prevent future recurrence.<br>
● In depth analysis of the data provided with relevant insight<br>
● Implications to the organisation and recommended decisions or actions<br>
● Recommendations for a robust solution to prevent future recurrence of the issue<br>
