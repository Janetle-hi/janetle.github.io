## Happiness and Freedom

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their 
citizens perceive themselves to be. Each year they survey people from more than 150 countries and ask questions about their 
happiness and other aspects in their lives such as social support, freedom, etc. 2019’s World Happiness Report focuses on happiness and the community: how happiness has 
evolved over the past dozen years, with a focus on the technologies, social norms, conflicts and government policies that have driven those changes.
