Airbnb is one of the largest online marketplaces for arranging or offering apartments, homestays and lodging. The number of bookings and listings are growing fast, there are over 6 million listings worldwide in 2019. New York is listed as one of the top 10 popular cities for booking experiences in the world. The total price of a reservation on Airbnb is based on the nightly rate (based price per night), which is sole set by the host, plus other fees such as service fees, cleaning fee, etc.
