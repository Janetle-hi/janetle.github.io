Airbnb is one of the largest online marketplaces for arranging or offering apartments, homestays and lodging. New York is listed as one of the top 10 popular cities for booking experiences in the world.However, there are currently no free and accurate services which help hosts price their properties using a wide range of data points. This project aims to help hosts determine a proper nightly rate based on the pricing model built from a range of relative factors in the New York Area.<br>

#### [Happiness and Freedom](/happiness.md)
<img src="images/newplot.png"/>
Essex lorry death tragedy (Oct 2019) has plunged millions of Vietnamese people into sorrow. This made me concerned about the gaps of nations that so many desperate people risk their life for chances at better economic opportunities. But is it the richer, the happier? How significant the gap between the Wealthy and the Poor? In this project, I will explore the data from World Happiness Report and Passport Ranking Index to see what data tells about Happiness & Freedom.

*Tools: Python, seaborn, Plotly*
